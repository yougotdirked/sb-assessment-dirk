## Project Description

This project serves as an assessment for an application for 'the Social Brothers'. It gets a list of blog posts from their API and also has a form to create new posts.
The API provides support for optional features such as search and sorting, which have not been implemented in this implementation.

## Project Setup

In the .env file, the following settings have to be configurated before this project will work:

```
BASE_URL = "__BASE_URL__"
TOKEN = "__TOKEN__"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL= "__NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL__"
```

```
 NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL 
``` is the same as ```{{BASE_URL}}/storage```
